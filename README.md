# Product Review Card Example

This is my take on a card that showcases a product for a store. It's responsive, so its display changes based on the size of the scren its being viewed on. I built it using Svelte.

## Responsiveness

The breakpoint from mobile to non-mobile screen size is 600px. I chose this based on my own intuition and testing. The mobile card looked too stretched on screen sizes larger than 600. The mobile version of the card has a `max-width` of 350px, and the non-mobile version has a `max-width` of 550px.
